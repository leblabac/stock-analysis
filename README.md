# Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to collect stock information for the years 2017 and 2018, and to determine whether or not the stocks are worth investing in. This process was originally completed within the green-stocks.xlsm file using multiple subroutines, however, the the task for this challenge was to increase the efficiency of the original code.

## Data
The data provided included two tables with stock information on 12 different stocks. Each stock had the following data: 
- a unique ticker value
- the date the stock was issued
- the opening price for a given date
- the high price for a given date
- the low price for a given date
- the closing price for a given date
- the adjusted close for a given date
- and the volume of the stock traded

The goal of the assignment was to refactor created code designed to locate/retrieve the ticker, to retrieve it's total volume traded for a given year, and to return its rate of return.

## Analysis







## Summary

### Pros and Cons of Refactoring Code
In terms of the pros and cons of refactoring code, the pros are that: refactored code has the ability to provide good debugging of code, increase the performance of the code, and, if instruction comments are written well, the ability to understand the code in a better way.  The cons of refactoring code are that it may take time to do - and its a con if the "cost" of refactoring the code is more "expensive" than actually keeping the original code.  Also, refactoring later in the code developemnt process can lead to less testing if a deadline is approaching, so may not be desirable if that is the case.
